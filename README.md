Natural-language search that works like `grep`. No embeddings, no index, no daemon.

- **Semantic:** Finds concepts ("where do we verify JWT tokens?"), not just strings.
- **No Index:** Searches the live tree on every run. Nothing to build, refresh, or go stale.
- **Calibrated:** Every path gets an absolute yes/no probability, so thresholds mean something and batches stay comparable.
- **Precise:** Returns files *and* line ranges, with original line numbers and merged adjacent passages.
- **Cheap:** Jev bills $0.042 per million input tokens, output free. A typical search over a few thousand files runs **$0.01–0.03**.
- **Agent-Ready:** `--json` output for scripts and coding agents, plus a benchmark harness for regressions.

## Quick Start

1. **Install**

   With [Rust and Cargo](https://rustup.rs) installed:

   ```bash
   cargo install jegrep
   ```

   Or download the archive for your platform from
   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/can1357/jegrep/releases/latest), extract it,
   and put `jegrep` (`jegrep.exe` on Windows) on your `PATH`. Releases include
   Linux and macOS binaries for x86-64 and ARM64, Windows x86-64 binaries, and
   `SHA256SUMS` checksums. Linux binaries require glibc 2.39 or newer.

   Or build from source with [rustup](https://rustup.rs):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/can1357/jegrep
   cd jegrep
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. **Setup**

   jegrep judges code with [Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai). By default it uses
   [classifier.dev](https://classifier.dev) — free, no API key, no account — so
   this step is optional. OpenRouter and TypeSafe are used as failover when
   their keys exist:

   ```bash
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
   # and/or
   export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...
   ```

   By default classifier.dev is tried first; when a key exists, OpenRouter or
   TypeSafe answers if classifier.dev fails (auth/credit failures (401/402/403),
   timeouts (408), rate limits (429), server errors (5xx), transport failures,
   and invalid responses). Pin a provider with `--endpoint classifier`,
   `--endpoint openrouter`, or `--endpoint typesafe`; a pinned OpenRouter/TypeSafe
   pair is used exclusively (classifier.dev is dropped from the chain). Other
   request errors (e.g. 400/422) are returned as-is. classifier.dev is free, so
   token/cost figures read zero while it serves the requests.

3. **Search**

   ```bash
   cd my-repo
   jegrep "where do we handle authentication?"
   ```

## Coding Agent Integration

`--json` emits the full result (scores, ranges, costs) best-first for callers:

```bash
jegrep "how is the database connection pooled?" --json | jq .
```

## Commands

### `jegrep [query] [path]`

The default command. Searches `path` (default `.`) for what `query` describes.

```bash
jegrep "how is the database connection pooled?"
```

**Options:**
| Flag | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-s`, `--strategy <name>` | Exploration strategy (see `--list-strategies`) | `cascade` |
| `-p`, `--parallel <n>` | Requests in flight | `16` |
| `-n`, `--batch <n>` | Soft frontier target per batch | `64` |
| `--max-batch <n>` | Hard cap of entries per request (≤ 255) | `128` |
| `-t`, `--thresholds <list>` | Relevance thresholds, one per round | `0.4,0.2` |
| `--bytes <n>` | Bytes of each file sent for the content check | `32768` |
| `--ranges <n>` | Heatmap line ranges per file | `16` |
| `--min-hits <n>` | Stop lowering thresholds once this many hits exist | `1` |
| `-k`, `--keywords <list>` | Extra grep keywords for grep-prior strategies | derived |
| `--endpoint <provider>` | `classifier` \| `openrouter` \| `typesafe` (classifier by default) | `classifier` |
| `--model <id>` | Jev model id or alias (ignored by classifier.dev) | `jev-latest` |
| `--hidden` | Include dot-files and dot-folders | `false` |
| `--tree` | Print the annotated exploration tree | `false` |
| `--json` | JSON output format | `false` |
| `--progress <mode>` | `live` \| `log` (terminal-aware fallback) | `live` |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Log every judgment | `false` |
| `-q`, `--quiet` | Suppress progress on stderr | `false` |

**Examples:**

```bash
# General concept search
jegrep "API rate limiting logic" .

# Previous strategy
jegrep "error handling" -s window .

# JSON for scripting
jegrep "config parsing" --json .

# Original scrolling log instead of the live view
jegrep --progress log "where are model aliases resolved?" .
```

### Strategies

| Name | Idea |
| --- | --- |
| `cascade` (default) | Sketch-routed global budget of verified full-source passages |
| `baseline` | Eager fill to N, one Noul per entry, fixed τ rounds, 32 KB content check |
| `beam` | Per-folder Choice + gate Noul; beam of top-K paths; flat Noul rescue pass |
| `sniff` | 1 KB heads of 32 files per request; survivors get the 32 KB check |
| `budget` | Rank-budgeted reads with a gap-rule cut instead of a fixed τ |
| `deep` | Recursive hot-folder listing; 8 KB-first reads upgraded to 32 KB if warm |
| `paged`, `paged-grep`, `paged-grep-fast`, `paged-grep-labels` | Per-folder cursors ordered by keyword hits (grep variants) |
| `inline`, `inline-16k`, `inline-shared`, `inline-solo` | Hot-file content inlined into the next request under a token budget |
| `window` | Ranked lexical candidates scored as bounded passages through selected files |
| `hybrid-window` | Beam discovery followed by window refinement |

Exploration policy is pluggable (`src/strategies/`). Each strategy drives the same
primitives — the lazily-listed `Tree`, the worker `Pool`, the question builders in
`questions.rs`, and the `jev::Client`. To add one: implement `Strategy` in
`src/strategies/<name>.rs` and register it in `strategies/mod.rs`.

## Configuration

There is no config file. Everything is CLI flags plus environment variables.

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | Optional failover provider keys (env or `~/.env`) | unset |
| `JEGREP_CASCADE_CANDIDATES` / `FILES` / `WINDOWS` / `BYTES` | Cascade candidate/file/passage/byte budgets | `128` / `20` / `24` / `8192` |
| `JEGREP_CASCADE_SKETCH_BYTES` / `FULL_LIMIT` / `CUTOFF` | Sketch size, full-passage cap, sketch cutoff | `384` / `40` / `0.45` |
| `JEGREP_WINDOW_CANDIDATES` / `FILES` / `PER_FILE` / `BYTES` / `PACK` | Window strategy budgets | — |
| `JEGREP_WINDOW_SCOUT_THRESHOLD` / `JEGREP_WINDOW_ADAPTIVE` / `JEGREP_WINDOW_COMPACT` | Window prefilter tuning | `0.5` / on / on |
| `JEGREP_QUESTION_CHUNK` | Split Noul batches (opt-in request splitting) | off |

### Ignoring Files

jegrep respects `.gitignore` (nested files honored) and skips lockfiles, build
outputs (`node_modules`, `target`, `dist`, …), and binary extensions. Dot-files
are excluded unless `--hidden` is passed.

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing found?** Thresholds lower automatically across rounds and cached
  judgments reopen — but you can also pass an explicit `-t 0.3,0.1`.
- **Weird results?** Re-run with `--verbose` and `--tree` to see every judgment.
- **Auth errors?** classifier.dev needs no key. If you pinned a keyed provider
  (`--endpoint openrouter` / `--endpoint typesafe`), check that key is set
  (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`).
- **Slow or pricey?** Lower `-n`/`--max-batch`, raise `-t`, or try `-s beam`/`budget`.

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/can1357/jegrep
cd jegrep
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

The native file walker is vendored in `src/walker/` from `pi-walker` 18.2.6
([upstream revision](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/tree/836048d81e088b4cddcd023780d6d769920e8525/crates/pi-walker)).
It is compiled into jegrep; publishing does not require a separate `pi-walker`
release. All Cargo dependencies resolve from crates.io.

To verify the publishable package without uploading it:

```bash
cargo publish --dry-run
```

## CI and Releases

GitHub Actions checks formatting, the configured Clippy lints, and the Python
benchmark-runner tests. It runs Rust tests and builds and smoke-tests release
binaries on all five supported platforms for pull requests and pushes to `main`.

To publish a release, update the version in `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`, commit
the change, then push a matching tag:

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.1 -m "jegrep 0.1.1"
git push origin main v0.1.1
```

The same checks gate tag builds. Tags must match the package version. Only after
every job passes does CI publish a GitHub Release with archives, licenses, and
checksums; versions with a prerelease suffix are marked as prereleases.
Publishing uses the repository's automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no release secret is
required. crates.io publishing is separate and is not enabled by this workflow.
